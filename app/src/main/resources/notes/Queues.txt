Queue is a data structure that follows the First In, First Out (FIFO) principle, 
meaning elements are added at the end and removed from the front. Imagine a line 
of people waiting to buy tickets: the first person in line is the first to get 
served.

Java provides the Queue interface in the java.util package, with various 
implementations to meet different needs. Common implementations include 
LinkedList, PriorityQueue, and ArrayDeque.

Key Queue Operations
    1. Enqueue (add/offer): Adds an element to the end of the queue.
    2. Dequeue (remove/poll): Removes an element from the front of the queue.
    3. Peek: Checks the front element without removing it.
    4. isEmpty: Checks if the queue is empty.

Queue Implementations in Java
    LinkedList: A flexible, general-purpose implementation that allows null values 
    and can function as a queue or deque. It supports FIFO and LIFO operations, 
    making it useful for many queue applications.

    ArrayDeque: Faster and more efficient than LinkedList for queue operations. It 
    doesn't allow null values and is recommended over LinkedList for queues and 
    stacks.

    PriorityQueue: A queue that orders elements based on their natural ordering or 
    a custom comparator, so elements are dequeued based on priority rather than order 
    of insertion.

When to Use a Queue
Queues are useful in scenarios where the order of processing is important, like:
    Task Scheduling: Managing tasks in an order of execution.
    Breadth-First Search (BFS): Traversing trees and graphs level by level.
    Print and Processing Jobs: Handling requests in the order theyâ€™re received (FIFO).

Summary
Queues are ideal for managing collections in a FIFO manner. The choice between 
LinkedList, ArrayDeque, and PriorityQueue depends on the use case:

Use ArrayDeque for general-purpose queues with high performance.
Use PriorityQueue if elements need to be processed in a specific order of priority.
