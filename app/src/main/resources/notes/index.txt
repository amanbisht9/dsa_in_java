-> What are data structures?
Data structures are ways of organizing and storing data so that we can use it efficiently. 
Think of them as containers that hold data in a specific way, making it easy to find, add, 
delete, or modify information when needed.

-> What is the importance of data structures?
The importance of data structures lies in their ability to handle data effectively, making
software development more efficient, organized, and scalable. Here are some key reasons data 
structures are so valuable:
    1. Enhanced Performance - Data structures allow us to optimize how data is stored and 
    accessed, directly improving a program's speed and responsiveness. Choosing the right 
    data structure can turn a slow, cumbersome application into a fast and smooth one.

    2. Efficient Data Management - They provide systematic ways to organize data, making it 
    easy to store, retrieve, and modify information. For example, databases use data structures 
    like trees and hash tables to manage large volumes of data efficiently.

    3. Better Resource Use - Efficient data structures help manage memory and processing power, 
    which is especially important for devices with limited resources, like mobile phones or embedded 
    systems.

    4. Solving Complex Problems - Many complex problems (such as network routing, database indexing, 
    or search engines) can be modeled with data structures like graphs, trees, and hash tables, making 
    it easier to design solutions.

    5. Modular Code - Data structures often allow us to build modular code, where each structure has its 
    responsibilities, leading to cleaner, more maintainable code.

    6. Scalability - Using the right data structures ensures that applications can handle growing amounts 
    of data or increased user loads effectively. For instance, scalable applications use efficient data structures 
    to handle high demand without slowing down.

    7. Foundational to Algorithms - Data structures and algorithms go hand in hand. Understanding data 
    structures is essential for implementing algorithms efficiently, as different algorithms rely on specific 
    data structures to function optimally.


-> Basic data structures?
Some of the basic data structures are as follows:
    1. Array
    2. Stack
    3. Queue
    4. Hash table
    5. Linked List
