An array is a data structure in Java (and many other languages) that allows you to store 
a fixed-size collection of elements of the same type. You can think of it as a series of "boxes"
each with a numbered label, where each "box" can store one element.

Here's how arrays work in Java with a practical example:

Key Points About Arrays:

Fixed Size: Once an array is created, its size cannot be changed.
Indexed Access: Each element in the array can be accessed using an index, starting from 0.
Homogeneous Elements: All elements in an array must be of the same data type (eg: int, String, double etc).

Benefits of Using Arrays
Organized: Arrays store multiple values in one variable.
Indexed Access: Allows fast access to elements by index.
Memory Efficient: Arrays are memory-efficient for fixed-size collections.

Arrays are helpful when you need to store a known number of items of the same type, like a list of scores, names, 
or in this case, ages.
