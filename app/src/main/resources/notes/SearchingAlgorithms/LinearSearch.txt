Linear Search is the simplest searching algorithm. It sequentially checks each element 
of the array until the target value is found or the array ends.

Characteristics:
    Best Case: O(1) (if the target is at the beginning)

    Worst Case:O(n) (if the target is at the end or not found)

    Works on unsorted or sorted data.

Example:
    Suppose we have an array:
    arr = {5, 3, 8, 6, 2}
    We want to find 6.

Steps:
    Compare 6 with arr[0] (5): not equal.
    Compare 6 with arr[1] (3): not equal.
    Compare 6 with arr[2] (8): not equal.
    Compare 6 with arr[3] (6): match found! Return index 3.
