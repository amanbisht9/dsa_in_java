Insertion Sort is a simple and intuitive sorting algorithm that works similarly 
to how you might sort playing cards in your hand. It builds the sorted portion 
of the list one element at a time by comparing and inserting the current element 
into its correct position relative to the already sorted portion.

Key Characteristics of Insertion Sort

Stable Sort: Preserves the relative order of equal elements.
Time Complexity:
    Best Case: O(n) (if the array is already sorted).
    Worst Case: O(n2) (if the array is sorted in reverse order).
    Average Case: O(n2).
    Space Complexity: O(1) (in-place sorting, no extra memory required).

Algorithm Steps

    1. Start with the second element in the array (consider the first element as sorted).
    2. Compare it with the elements in the sorted portion.
    3. Insert it into its correct position.
    4. Repeat for all elements until the entire array is sorted.
