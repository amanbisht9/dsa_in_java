Bubble Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, 
compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. This 
process is repeated until the list is sorted. It is called "bubble sort" because 
smaller elements "bubble" to the top of the list.

Key Characteristics of Bubble Sort

    Stable Sort: Maintains the relative order of equal elements.

    Time Complexity:
        Best Case: O(n) (when the array is already sorted).
        Worst Case: O(n2) (when the array is sorted in reverse order).
        Average Case: O(n2).

    Space Complexity: O(1) (in-place sorting, no additional storage required).

Bubble Sort Algorithm

    1. Compare adjacent elements in the list.
    2. Swap them if they are in the wrong order.
    3. Repeat the process for each element in the list.
    4. Continue until no swaps are required, meaning the list is sorted.
