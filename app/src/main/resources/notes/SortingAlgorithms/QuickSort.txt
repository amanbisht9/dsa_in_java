Quick Sort is a popular divide and conquer sorting algorithm. It works by 
selecting a "pivot" element, partitioning the array into two subarrays around 
the pivot (elements smaller than the pivot and elements larger than the pivot), 
and then recursively sorting the subarrays.

Steps of Quick Sort:
    1. Choose a Pivot: Select an element from the array as the pivot (commonly the 
    last element, first element, or a random element).
    2. Partition: Rearrange the array so that all elements smaller than the pivot 
    are on the left and all elements larger are on the right.
    3. Recursively Sort: Apply the above steps to the subarrays on the left and 
    right of the pivot.

Example:
    Letâ€™s sort the array [10, 80, 30, 90, 40, 50, 70].

    Steps:
    Choose pivot = 70.

    Partition: [10, 30, 40, 50] (smaller than pivot), [70] (pivot), [80, 90] (larger than pivot).
    Array after partition: [10, 30, 40, 50, 70, 80, 90].
    Recursively sort the left subarray [10, 30, 40, 50]:

    Pivot = 50.
    Partition: [10, 30, 40] (smaller), [50] (pivot), [] (larger).
    Array after partition: [10, 30, 40, 50].
    Recursively sort [10, 30, 40]:

    Pivot = 40.
    Partition: [10, 30] (smaller), [40] (pivot), [] (larger).
    Array after partition: [10, 30, 40].
    Continue recursively until all subarrays have one element.
