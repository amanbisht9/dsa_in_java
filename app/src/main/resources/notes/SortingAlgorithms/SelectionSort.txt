Selection Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that divides the array into two parts: 
the sorted portion and the unsorted portion. It repeatedly selects the smallest 
(or largest) element from the unsorted portion and swaps it with the first 
element of the unsorted portion.

Steps of Selection Sort:
    1. Start from the first element and consider it the minimum.
    2. Compare it with every other element in the unsorted portion of the array.
    3. If a smaller element is found, update the minimum.
    4. Swap the minimum element with the first element of the unsorted portion.
    5. Repeat this process for each element in the array, moving the boundary of the sorted portion forward.

Example
    Letâ€™s sort the array:
    [64, 25, 12, 22, 11]

Steps:
    Find the minimum in [64, 25, 12, 22, 11]
    The minimum is 11. Swap it with 64.
    Array: [11, 25, 12, 22, 64]

    Find the minimum in [25, 12, 22, 64]
    The minimum is 12. Swap it with 25.
    Array: [11, 12, 25, 22, 64]

    Find the minimum in [25, 22, 64]
    The minimum is 22. Swap it with 25.
    Array: [11, 12, 22, 25, 64]

    Find the minimum in [25, 64]
    The minimum is 25. Swap it with 25 (no change).
    Array: [11, 12, 22, 25, 64]

    Last element (64) is already sorted.
